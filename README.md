# Setup project with hardhat

1. Install hardhat `npm install --save-dev hardhat`
2. Install packages: `npm install`
3. Install shorthand: `npm i -g hardhat-shorthand` after install can run hardhat command by `hh` instead of `npx hardhat`

# Compile, deploy and verify smart contract

## Deploy and Verify:

**Command**
1. Set env vars
2. Deploy contract: `hh run scripts/deploy.ts --network <network>`
3. Verify contract: `hh verify <contract_address> --contract contracts/Zombiezoo.sol:NFT --network <network>`

# Testing

**Command**
  `hh test`

## Test cases
  ```
     ZombiezooNFT contract
    #initialize
      ✔ sets name is Zombiezoo
      ✔ sets symbol is ZBZ
      ✔ sets UNIT_PRICE is 0.8 eth
      ✔ sets MAX_PRESALE_PER_MINTER is 2
      ✔ sets owner is deployer
      ✔ sets owner is verifier
      ✔ grants owner is Admin
    #supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) external view returns (bool)
      when supports ERC721 - Non-Fungible Token Standard
        ✔ returns true
      when supports ERC721Metadata - Non-Fungible Token Standard metadata extension
        ✔ returns true
      when supports EIP2981 - NFT Royalty Standard
        ✔ returns true
    #transferOwnership(address newOwner) external onlyOwner
      ✔ sets new owner for contract
      when caller is not owner
        ✔ reverts with Ownable:
    #setVerifier(address verifier_) external onlyAdmin
      ✔ sets verifier
      when caller is not admin
        ✔ reverts with AccessControl:
    #revokeVerifier(address verifier_) external onlyAdmin
      ✔ revokes verifier
      when caller is not admin
        ✔ reverts with AccessControl:
    #activate(uint256 startIndex_, uint256 totalSupply_, string memory tokenURI_, address fundRecipient_) external onlyAdmin
      when caller is admin
        ✔ sets startIndex for token ID is 50, and can mint from token ID 51
        ✔ sets totalSupply is 1000
        ✔ sets baseURI is https://nft.uri
        ✔ sets fundRecipient
        ✔ sets tokenIndex is 50
        ✔ sets royaltyInfo is fundRecipient and 10%
        when already activated
          ✔ reverts with ZBZ: Already activated
      when caller is not admin
        ✔ reverts with AccessControl:
    #mintTo(address toAddress, uint256 tokenId) external onlyAdmin
      ✔ mints tokenID to toAddress
      ✔ increases toAddress balance by 1
      when tokenId already minted
        ✔ reverts with ERC721: token already minted
      when tokenId is 0
        ✔ reverts with ZBZ: Invalid tokenId
      when tokenId is greater than startIndex
        ✔ reverts with ZBZ: Invalid tokenId
      when caller is not admin
        ✔ reverts with AccessControl:
    #mint(uint256 salt, bytes memory sig) external nonReentrant payable
      ✔ marks sig is finalized
      ✔ increases tokenIndex by 1
      ✔ sets right tokenURI minter balance
      ✔ increases minter balance by 1
      ✔ sends funds to fundRecipient
      ✔ mints tokenID to minter
      ✔ mints VIP/KOLs tokenID to minter
      when preSaleRoot exists
        when valid proof
          ✔ mints tokenID to minter
          when minted is greater than MAX_PRESALE_PER_MINTER(is 2)
            ✔ reverts ZBZ: Can not mint
        when proof is empty
          ✔ reverts ZBZ: Can not mint
        when invalid proof
          ✔ reverts ZBZ: Can not mint
        when set preSaleRoot is empty
          ✔ when call mint with empty proof, mints tokenID to minter
      when value is less than UNIT_PRICE
        ✔ reverts ZBZ: Invalid amount
      when minter mint a not exits tokenID
        ✔ reverts ZBZ: Reach total supply (105ms)
      when sig used
        ✔ reverts ZBZ: Salt Used
      when sig recover is not a verifier
        ✔ reverts ZBZ: Unauthorized
